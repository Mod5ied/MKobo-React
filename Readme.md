# MKobo Frontend Assessment (React Implementation)

* This is an unfinished attempt at the frontend test I had submitted, which has the UI rendered using only HTML/CSS.

## Getting Started

* Clone the project from github (links provided already) onto your machine.
* Install the few dependencies necessary to run the app.
* Run ``npm run dev`` to run the app in dev mode.
* Enjoy!
